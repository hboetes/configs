mutt configfiles:

This mutt-config is specially aimed at the use of Maildir.

Off course this is much more than just a mutt config file. You will have
to install a lot more programs than just mutt and most off them can also
be very complex.

But if you do take the effort to sort it all out you will have started
on the road to complete control over your e-mail.

I tried to make all files as much as possible like an example. Not
making more examples then needed. Although I do use this config myself
:]

If you think you have a very good reason to ask me you can send me an
e-mail. But most problems are much faster and better solved by searching
through man-pages, websites, newsgroups, mailing-lists. Off course:
start at mutt.org.

If you find errors please check if you have the latest versions and if
you do please e-mail me so I can correct the errors. Also I'd like to
see your great ideas and additions.

1) Program files:

The following programs should be provided by your 'distro' and
installation should be pretty straightforward.

  A mail-server. Doesn't matter which. The easiest is esmtp I guess.

  fetchmail/getmail (I prefer getmail)

  procmail/maildrop (maildrop is really much better)

  mutt urlview

  safecat

  gnupg

Easy to install with your 'distros' packages but you will need to read
this manual:

  http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html

And last but not least.

  gpg-2comp

Which was lost from the internet so I keep a copy in my cvs for your comfort.


Don't worry too much about the gpg-stuff; mutt will work fine
without it.


2) Configuration files.

For you're comfort I made a tarball from the whole dir with the
scp script.

All files in this directory should be saved in $HOME/.mutt accept for
the dot-* files. They should be placed in your $HOME directory and
renamed to .file

For example:

  $ mv $HOME/.mutt/dot-procmailrc $HOME/.procmailrc

or even better: make a symlink. ;)


3) Streaming schedule, for understanding. Other solution are also very
   well possible.

  fetchmail fetches mail from other-mailserver and sends it to the MTA.
  MTA sends the message to procmail. procmail puts the mail in the
  right folder.

4) Thank you, Thank you.

I didn't invent this all myself. I just made it so that I do like it. I
would like to thank the following peoples.

  Michael Elkins   : For making mutt and the excellent manual.
  and all other
  maintainers

  Roland Rosenfeld : For making the most well documented config-file
                     with lots off examples. This is a real
                     refference... Check it out.

  Chris Gushue     : Who has had the great idea to split up all
                     configuration files in a structured way. I
                     just started were he finished.
